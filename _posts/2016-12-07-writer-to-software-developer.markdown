Back to the end of October 2015 and I was rocking up to London's Twitter HQ with my ancient laptop slowly carving a permanent groove in my shoulder with its dead weight.

I was here for the <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First: Girls</a> beginners course on HTML and CSS. If you haven't heard of them before, Code First: Girls are an amazing organisation that offer free (yes, free!) coding courses to girls.

Being an English Literature student turned writer/marketer/person-who-sends-lots-of-emails, my only previous experience with coding had been blindly jabbing away at the CSS on my old Wordpress blog (RIP) despite not having a clue what it all meant.

..but everyone is a beginner at some point. So after settling down at a table and feeling slightly like I was at my first day at school, the coding started and it got me hook, line and sinker from then on in.

After winning the end-of-course group competition with a website about <a href="https://free-cakes-for-kids.herokuapp.com/index.html">cake</a>, I went on to take Code First: Girls' advanced course in Ruby, attended a tonne of other events with companies like <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>, quit my job, started Makers Academy (an intensive coding bootcamp) and finished with a job at the end. Phew!

Now I'm a REAL LIFE software developer and I couldn't be more happy with the path that I took.

I've started this blog to document things I've learnt and share some tips on what has worked for me :)
